Hi There! I'm Pushan and welcome to my GitHub Repository.

Some things to know about me:
- 📚 I am a Grade 11 High School Student enrolled in the Advanced Placement (AP) Program.
- 🧑🏽‍💻 I am interested in Computer Science and Technology, fueled by my passion in coding, engineering, and mathematics. 
- 👾 My current goal is to expand my horizons in programming in various languages, and share my projects for open feedback and improvement in what I can do better!
- 🌱 As a life-long learner with an endless curiosity to fulfill, I am hoping GitHub will provide opportunities to further improve my software development skills and help me connect to other like-minded individuals.
